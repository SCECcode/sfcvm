# Running the code

There are two main ways to run the code:

* Use the `geomodelgrids` suite of command line programs, or
* Call the API from your own code.

The `geomodelgrids` suite of command line programs targets end users who simply want to query for values in a model at a set of locations.
For additional details on how this program works, see the "Command line programs" section.

We also provide an API for calling the query routines from external code.
See the [C++ API](../user/cxx-api/index.md) and [C API](../user/c-api/index.md) sections for more information.
